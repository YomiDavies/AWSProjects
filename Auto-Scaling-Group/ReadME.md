This Project was inspired by Fisayomi Fashanu of Cloud Career Mentor. One of the benefits of the cloud deployment is that infrastructure can be scaled easier and quicker compared to on premises deployment.

                        Project Scenario
                        
A company has an ec2 instance hosting a web server, everything is stable until the marketing department starts running a sales promotion that proves to be very popular with its customers, as a result of this the website receives a spike in traffic at different times. Every time there is a spike in traffic the server gets overloaded until it fails, which causes the website to go down, this then leads to customers being disgruntled because they cant access the site. The tech department then considers some scaling options like vertical scaling which is when the instance resources are increased e.g if the original instance 2vCpu and 5 Gig of RAM, vertical scaling will be making it 5vCpu and 10 Gig of RAM, but after digging deeper into the data they realized that the spike only occurs once or twice a week and then the cost of having a larger instance far outweighs the benefits.
After some extra consideration your tech leads decides on horizontal scaling, which is where more instances are added to meet the increase in demand, this means rather than have one big instance you can have two or three smaller instances that can be scaled up or down depending on traffic levels through auto-scaling. 
My task is now to setup auto scaling so this solution happens automaticaly. The goal is to create a webserver that can scale up and down to meet traffic demands for example if the website is getting alot of traffic then it adds more ec2 instances to deal with the increase workload and when the traffic goesdown it reduces the number of ec2 instances to save on cost
