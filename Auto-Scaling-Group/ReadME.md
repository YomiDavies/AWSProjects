This project demonstrates my understanding of the importance of concepts such as auto scaling, cost saving and Security. In this project i will implement a solution for an E-commerce website that has an ec2 instance hosting a web server. Everything is stable until the sales department starts a sales promotion that instantly becomes popular. As a result of this, the website receives a spike in traffic at different times. Every time there is a spike in traffic the server gets overloaded until it fails, which causes the website to go down, this then leads to customers being disgruntled because they can't access the site
