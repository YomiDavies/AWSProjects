This Project is a reflection of the importance that i accord to concepts like, auto scaling, cost saving and seciurity.
In this project i implemented asolution  for an e-commerce website that has an ec2 instance hosting a web server, everything is stable until the sales department starts a sales promotion that instantly becomes popular, as a result , this website receives a spike in traffic at different times. 
Everytime there is a spike in traffic, the server gets overloaded until it fails, which causes the website to go down, this then leads to customers being disgruntled because they can't access the site. The tech team then brainstorm and considers some scaling alternatives like vertical scaling,
